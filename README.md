# Livereload.js Processwire Module

This module injects the Livereload javascript to the `<head>` area  of your document so you don't need to use the browser extension version. Most of the code in this module are taken from this  thread: http://processwire.com/talk/topic/4472-how-to-insert-scripts-and-stylesheets-from-your-module/

Note: in order to use this module you'd need a LiveReload watcher, eg: [guard-livereload](https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload) or [grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch).
